# Paralell programming
The aim of this programme is processing random DNA sequence and calculate the length of the longest serial nucleotides. The tasks will be processed serially and paralelly to observe the time of each process.
This programme includes four files:
1. seq_longest_continuous.py:
Count the length of the longest contiguous subsequences.
2. seq_all_longest.py:
Find the longest subsequences across multiple sequences.
3. test_seq_longest.py:
pytest for among files.
4. longest_sub.py:
Provides demonstrating functions to processes a large amount of random data serially and paralelly.
